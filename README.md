# Hypixel Boosters Viewer

This viewer shows the queued and stacked boosters of each hypixel game.
Help you place boosters at the **_perfect_** moments for hypxixel experiences.
See https://hypixel.net/threads/guide-everything-about-network-boosters.2465740/.

In hindsight, you should probably use https://plancke.io/hypixel/boosters/.
